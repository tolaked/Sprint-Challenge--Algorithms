#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)o(n):The while loop is dependent on n, as n increases the runtime increases.


b)O(n^2):This as a result of the nested loop both dependent on number of items, the first loop runs n times while the second loop runs n-1 times


c)O(n): It executes once every time it decrements the value n therefore as n increases the runtime increases linearly

## Exercise II
